# TrustTable

TrustTable is a local-first, AI-assisted data quality investigator for business datasets.

It combines deterministic profiling and rule-based detection with evidence-grounded LLM interpretation. Calculated facts remain authoritative; AI is used to infer context, ask focused questions, explain findings, recommend remediation, and describe validation rules.

## Project status

**v0.1 — Deterministic vertical slice: complete and recorded release-ready.** Every bullet in `docs/release-plan.md`'s v0.1 checklist is implemented and tested; all three release-qualification areas (performance evidence, security qualification, release-candidate testing) have real, scoped-baseline evidence; the human owner recorded v0.1 milestone-complete/release-ready. This does **not** itself constitute full `docs/testing-strategy.md` §8 release-candidate CI-gate compliance: the full multi-browser/viewport matrix, SBOM/container scan/license check, full deterministic/AI evaluation, and migration tests remain open, mostly scoped to the later v1.0 milestone.

**Current milestone: v0.1.1 — Investigation UX.** `FIND-01` (row context for row-anchored findings) — this milestone's sole planned deliverable — is implemented in full: the row-context API endpoint, and a Finding Detail UI section with expand and Prev/Next navigation across a finding's own affected rows (see "Delivered work" below).

Local AI beta (v0.2) work has also begun with the AI provider interface (interface-only — no real provider is wired in yet).

The product, domain model, API boundaries, detector framework, frontend architecture, testing strategy, threat model, release plan, and implementation backlog were all defined before production implementation began (see `docs/`).

### Delivered work

**Foundation**

- **FND-01** — repository foundation: runnable backend/frontend skeleton, Docker Compose baseline.
- **FND-02** — typed configuration from `.env.example`.
- **FND-03** — continuous integration (formatting, lint, types, tests, dependency scan).
- **FND-04** — structured API errors and request IDs.
- **FND-05** — OpenAPI-generated frontend contract pipeline, with a CI drift check.

**v0.1 — Deterministic vertical slice**

- **DEMO-01** — synthetic sales-demo generator (deterministic, 13 injected issue types).
- **ING-01 / ING-02** — parsing contracts and a secure CSV parser.
- **PROF-01 / PROF-02 / PROF-03** — profiling schemas, type inference, and core profiling metrics.
- **DET-01 / DET-02** — the detector interface and the full initial detector set (all 12 deterministic detectors: duplicate rows, empty columns, excessive missing values, missing likely identifiers, inconsistent capitalization, leading/trailing whitespace, future dates, negative measures, invalid percentages, line-total mismatch, suspiciously constant columns, extreme outliers).
- **SEC-02** — the LLM input/output trust boundary (untrusted-data envelope, safe prompt builder, model-output validator); no real LLM provider is wired in yet.
- **DET-SEC-01** — the prompt-injection risk detector (`security.possible_llm_prompt_injection`), completing the detector catalogue at 13/13.
- **RISK-01** — deterministic risk scoring: per-finding priority scores and a four-label dataset trust assessment, computed with no AI/LLM input path at all.
- **API-01** — the analysis API: an in-memory orchestration engine (parsing → profiling → detection → scoring) exposed over real `/api/v1` HTTP routes — `POST /demo/sales`, `GET /analyses/{id}`, `.../status`, `.../profile`, `.../findings`, `.../findings/{finding_id}`, `.../findings/{finding_id}/evidence`, `POST .../cancel`.
- **UI-01** — the basic investigation UI, complete: a Start screen (sales-demo action plus generic CSV upload), a named-stage progress view, an Overview screen (trust assessment, top findings, dataset summary), a Findings list (severity/category/search filtering), a Finding detail screen (evidence, representative examples, technical metadata, and honestly-disclosed not-yet-available business-impact/remediation/validation-rule/review sections no package computes yet), and a dedicated prompt-injection-warning presentation for `ai_processing_security` findings.
- **REL-01** (scoped) — Docker Compose production-configuration hardening: both services now restart automatically after an unexpected exit; SBOM generation and container image scanning are explicitly deferred to `SEC-01`'s later, full scope.
- **API-01, extending** — generic CSV file-upload analysis creation (`POST /api/v1/analyses`, CSV only, with extension/size validation and filename sanitization; `.xlsx` remains `ING-03`, a later backlog item) — completing every remaining `docs/release-plan.md` v0.1 checklist item.

**v0.1 release-qualification (scoped baselines)**

- **PERF-01** (v0.1-scoped) — a performance baseline across 10k/100k/250k-row and one wide-column synthetic case; full v1.0-scale benchmarking and tuning remain open.
- **SEC-01** (v0.1-scoped) — a security-qualification review closing a logging-safety test gap and adding an unsafe-HTML-rendering regression guard; SBOM generation, container scanning, and license checking remain `SEC-01`'s later, full scope.
- **BROWSER-01 / A11Y-01** (v0.1-scoped) — release-candidate testing qualification: the first live execution of the Chromium/axe-core browser-accessibility suite against the real Docker Compose stack (6/6 tests passing); the full multi-browser/viewport matrix and full accessibility suite remain open, later v1.0-milestone scope.

**v0.1.1 — Investigation UX (complete)**

- **FIND-01** — row context for row-anchored findings: `GET /api/v1/analyses/{id}/findings/{finding_id}/row-context` returns a bounded (max 25 rows per side) physical-neighborhood window around one of a finding's own affected rows, reconstructed on demand from the analysis's retained upload bytes (never a standing `ParsedDataset`); the Finding Detail screen's new "Row context" section renders it with the anchor row highlighted, an expand control, and, for findings with more than one affected row, Prev/Next navigation between them. Not `Evidence`, not in Report/export output, never automatic AI-prompt input (`docs/decision-log.md` D-025).

**Local AI beta (v0.2 — begun)**

- **AI-01** (interface-only) — the AI provider interface: a framework-independent contract package (the six model-call operations, request/response/health-check shapes, a provider-error hierarchy, and the `AIProvider` protocol every future provider implements against); no real provider is wired in yet — that is `AI-02` (disabled/mock) and `AI-03` (Ollama), later backlog items.

The first production target is a local, single-instance application that:

- runs through Docker
- analyzes CSV and Excel files
- remains useful without an LLM
- optionally uses a locally downloaded model through Ollama
- requires no paid inference API
- treats uploaded values as untrusted data
- detects and reports possible prompt-injection content
- is tested against explicit release gates

A public hosted demonstration is deliberately deferred until the local application is complete and proven.

## Running it today

The backend and frontend skeleton can be started right now, native or
through Docker Compose — see [Local development](docs/local-development.md)
for exact commands. The bundled deterministic demo dataset is
[`demo-data/sales_demo.csv`](demo-data/sales_demo.csv).

The full deterministic pipeline (CSV parsing, type inference, profiling,
detection, and risk scoring) is reachable both through the running
backend API directly (`POST /api/v1/demo/sales`, `POST
/api/v1/analyses` (CSV upload), `GET /api/v1/analyses/{id}`,
`.../status`, `.../profile`, `.../findings`, `GET
.../findings/{finding_id}`, `GET .../findings/{finding_id}/evidence`,
`GET .../findings/{finding_id}/row-context`,
`POST .../cancel`) and through the real frontend: open the running app
and either choose "Try the sales demo" or upload your own `.csv` file
on the Start screen to see a progress view, a trust-assessment Overview,
a filterable Findings list, and — by selecting any finding — a Finding
detail screen with its evidence, a "Row context" section around any of
its own affected rows (row-anchored findings only), or, for the
prompt-injection detector's own finding, a dedicated warning
presentation explaining what was detected, whether it was sent to a
model, and what protections apply.
Excel (`.xlsx`) upload is not yet supported (**ING-03**, a later
backlog item) — only `.csv` files are accepted today.
[Local development](docs/local-development.md#exercising-the-deterministic-profiling-pipeline-directly)
still has a reproducible way to exercise the pipeline directly in
Python, without the API, if preferred.

## Planned user workflow

```text
Upload → Understand → Analyze → Review → Export
```

1. Upload a CSV or Excel dataset, or load the synthetic sales demonstration.
2. Review TrustTable's inferred understanding of the dataset.
3. Answer a small number of business-context questions.
4. Inspect prioritized, evidence-backed findings.
5. Confirm, dismiss, or investigate findings.
6. Review remediation advice and executable validation rules.
7. Export a Markdown report and JSON or YAML rules.

## Engineering principles

- Deterministic code calculates facts.
- AI interpretation cannot erase or replace deterministic findings.
- Every factual statement must resolve to computed evidence.
- Uploaded values, column names, worksheet names, and model responses are untrusted.
- Model responses are schema-validated before use.
- The complete application works with AI disabled.
- Local Ollama integration must not require an API key.
- Version 1 avoids unnecessary distributed infrastructure.
