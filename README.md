# TrustTable

TrustTable is a local-first, AI-assisted data quality investigator for business datasets.

It combines deterministic profiling and rule-based detection with evidence-grounded LLM interpretation. Calculated facts remain authoritative; AI is used to infer context, ask focused questions, explain findings, recommend remediation, and describe validation rules.

## Project status

TrustTable has completed its repository foundation (**FND-01**), typed configuration (**FND-02**), continuous integration (**FND-03**), common API errors (**FND-04**), the OpenAPI frontend contract pipeline (**FND-05**), the synthetic sales generator (**DEMO-01**), and the parsing contracts (**ING-01**), and is now continuing toward **v0.1 — the deterministic vertical slice**.

The product, domain model, API boundaries, detector framework, frontend architecture, testing strategy, threat model, release plan, and implementation backlog have been defined before production implementation begins. A runnable backend and frontend skeleton, Docker/Nginx deployment, and baseline test tooling now exist; no product features are implemented yet.

The first production target is a local, single-instance application that:

- runs through Docker
- analyzes CSV and Excel files
- remains useful without an LLM
- optionally uses a locally downloaded model through Ollama
- requires no paid inference API
- treats uploaded values as untrusted data
- detects and reports possible prompt-injection content
- is tested against explicit release gates

A public hosted demonstration is deliberately deferred until the local application is complete and proven.

## Planned user workflow

```text
Upload → Understand → Analyze → Review → Export
```

1. Upload a CSV or Excel dataset, or load the synthetic sales demonstration.
2. Review TrustTable's inferred understanding of the dataset.
3. Answer a small number of business-context questions.
4. Inspect prioritized, evidence-backed findings.
5. Confirm, dismiss, or investigate findings.
6. Review remediation advice and executable validation rules.
7. Export a Markdown report and JSON or YAML rules.

## Engineering principles

- Deterministic code calculates facts.
- AI interpretation cannot erase or replace deterministic findings.
- Every factual statement must resolve to computed evidence.
- Uploaded values, column names, worksheet names, and model responses are untrusted.
- Model responses are schema-validated before use.
- The complete application works with AI disabled.
- Local Ollama integration must not require an API key.
- Version 1 avoids unnecessary distributed infrastructure.

## Supported production boundary

Version 1 is a production-quality, local-first, single-instance application.

Formally supported development and deployment environments:

- Linux x86-64
- Windows 11 with WSL2 and Docker Desktop

Current Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari are target browsers. Native Windows execution without WSL is not a version 1 requirement.
